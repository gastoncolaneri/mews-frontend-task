# Frontend task - Search movie app

## üöÄ Project overview

This is a Frontend application where the user can filter movies just typing in the input text.
When the application is loaded, the user can see some of the most popular movies. Once the user start typing, the application filter them. Additionally, a dark/light theme switch was implemented to improve the user experience.

This proyect was created using **React**. For styling, **Styled-Component** was chosen. Additionally, **Vite** was used because it simplifies setup and development by offering minimal configuration by default. It also integrates **TanStack React Query** for data retrieval and caching, **Zustand** for managing the application's global state, and **React Router** for page navigation.
